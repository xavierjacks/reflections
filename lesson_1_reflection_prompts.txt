How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to compare the before and after effects of each commit.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would be able to work more productively and create more efficient UX.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have more control of which version would be saved when doing manually however if you tend to forget when to save during revisions you may lose important commits.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I am a blank...


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows you see the log of commit, git diff you can compare differences between the log of commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I do "break" something I can look up the commit prior to the change and try again.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   My Udacity projects and setting up repositories.
